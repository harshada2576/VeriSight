# VeriSight Frontend (starter)

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind starter scaffold created to match the dark blue VeriSight design you provided.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The starter includes:
- Landing / Home
- How It Works
- Pricing
- Demo
- Header + Footer
- Tailwind configuration with your color palette

This is intentionally a focused UI scaffold to ship quickly for your hackathon. Next steps I can add on request:
- Full Auth flow
- Upload widget with presigned/resumable support
- JobStatus / JobDetail pages
- Evidence viewers (heatmap, spectrogram)
- Verification pack download + signature validation
